FileMangoExampleModule is a java program that implements the analysis module protocol (JSON over stdio; See Message class) used in https://github.com/Johnnydouble/FileMango.

It reads data from stdin, performs basic image analysis on the file at the path provided, returns the gleaned metadata tags, and exits.
